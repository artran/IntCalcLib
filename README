Integer Maths Library

Implement a library to handle the basic arithmetic functions on integer operands.

You can assume the following:
* Implement the following functions:
** add
** subtract
** multiply
** divide
* You can only use + and - operators. The *, / & % operators are specifically excluded, as is the java.lang.Math object.
* All operands will be positive integers between zero and Integer.MAX_VALUE, inclusive.
* Results will be integers between Integer.MIN_VALUE & Integer.MAX_VALUE, inclusive.
* All functions must be thoroughly unit tested using JUnit4 tests. Fest assertions may be used.
